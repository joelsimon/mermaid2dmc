# Generate diff comparing GeoCSV file in the second-to-last and most recent
# archive, and print lines that changed between old ('<') and new ('>').
#
# If nothing changed, and the file was only appended to, the only lines that are
# printed (beginning with '<') should be header/comment lines.
#
# Removes first column (which contains automaid version and thus generate diffs
# for every line with every new version) before performing diff.
